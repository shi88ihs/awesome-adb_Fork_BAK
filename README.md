## Basic Usage

### Command Syntax

```sh
adb [-d | -e | -s <serialNumber>] <command>
````

If only one device/emulator is connected, you can omit the device selector.

### Targeting a Specific Device

| Flag                | Description                                           |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `-d`                | Target the only USB-connected device                  |
| `-e`                | Target the only emulator                              |
| `-s <serialNumber>` | Target a specific device or emulator by serial number |

You can get the list of serial numbers by:

```sh
adb devices
```

Example:

```sh
adb -s emulator-5554 shell wm size
```

### Start/Stop ADB Server

Start ADB server:

```sh
adb start-server
```

Stop ADB server:

```sh
adb kill-server
```

### Check ADB Version

```sh
adb version
```

Example:

```sh
Android Debug Bridge version 1.0.41
Version 30.0.5-6877874
```

### Run adbd as Root

```sh
adb root
```

To revert:

```sh
adb unroot
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Some devices (e.g. Samsung production builds) do not support `adb root`.

### Set ADB Server Port

```sh
adb -P <port> start-server
```

Default is usually 5555. Find the $IP $PORT in Dev Settings or if you have root and termux, set this port to whatever you want.
